- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @morgan-young.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in back end development with python and AWS mostly. GCP when I have to. Azure when I am literally forced to.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about agentic frameworks and the next gen web scrapers/UI automation tools.

- ðŸ”¨ I work for myself and for other people, building and contributing to products which try and solve real problems.

P.S you really don't need kubernetes yet.
