- 👋 Hi, I’m @morgan-young.

- 👀 I’m interested in back end development with python and AWS mostly. GCP when I have to. Azure when I am literally forced to.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about agentic frameworks and the next gen web scrapers/UI automation tools.

- 🔨 I work for myself and for other people, building and contributing to products which try and solve real problems. I build with a "you aren't gnna need it" approach until I'm proven otherwise. At which point, I build it.
