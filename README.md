- 👋 Hi, I’m @morgan-young.

- 👀 I’m interested in back end development with python and AWS mostly. GCP when I have to. Azure when I am literally forced to.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about agentic frameworks and the next gen web scrapers/UI automation tools.

- 🔨 I work for myself and for other people, building and contributing to products which try and solve real problems. I build with a "you aren't gnna need it" approach until I'm proven otherwise. At which point, I build it.

FYI on how I use Gen-AI toosl:

1. I use the tab autocomplete a lot and will also use it to generate specific code sections that I review before slotting them into a certain file where I understand the context very well.
2. I use it as a pair-programmer and get it to play devil's advocate with my code.
3. I will NEVER use it to generate a whole file from scratch and integrate it into an existing codebase.
4. I will NEVER EVER use it to generate a whole application (try to maintain that and lmk how it goes for you).
5. I will NEVER EVER EVER say "idk, AI wrote that" when asked what something does. If I wrote part of it with AI's help, that's cool, but the moment I submit any of it as a PR it becomes my code and my responsibility.
